### Hey folks! 👋

I'm a Software Engineer with over 25 years of experience, passionate about technology and development. ([check my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/disarli))

My heart beats at my fingertips, at about 100 keys per minute creating disruptive, resilient, reliable technological solutions in high availability and performance environments.

Lover of well written codes and good practices (just don't ask me about Liskov). My biggest pride is having 200% test coverage on my PHP microframework for microservices ([ala-microservice-php](https://github.com/kiwfy/ala-microservice-php)). (I know, sounds weird, but I can explain: 100% coverage in unit tests + 100% coverage in feature tests)

Proud founder of the [Kiwfy Software Foundation](https://github.com/kiwfy), a non-profit organization to foster the development of scalable open source solutions, with modern, easy-to-use technology to improve the lives of developers and enthusiasts.

Technological alchemist, using Linux, PHP, Node, Python, Go, Docker, Elasticsearch, Redis and other ingredients, to try to find the philosopher's stone, or at least reduce the amount of bugs ;)

Expert in cloud computing, especially AWS.

Very rare specimen of developer who doesn't drink coffee.

Advocate and Evangelist for Full Cycle Development and Microservices Architecture. But feel free to change my mind!
